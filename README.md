# DeathStarInSpace
Lets send a Star Wars Death Star and Alderaan planet (or Earth) model into space in time for the release of the Star Wars VIII movie coming out in Dec 2017. www.solarsystemexpress.com/death-star-in-space.html

We will develop and launch a miniature (less than 10 cm) Star Wars Death Star and Alderaan (or Earth) planet model into Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in time for the release of the Star Wars VIII movie coming out Dec 15, 2017. 

We will be launching a $99K crowd funding campaign Nov 16, 2016 to raise funding for the flight hardware and launch cost. The last day of the crowd funding campaign will be on the Rogue One release date of Dec 16, 2016.

The Death Star will contain three working lasers (450 mW total) and one camera to test laser communication and power beaming in space (a commercial first) and will trigger Alderaan (or Earth) model to blow up.

The Alderaan (or Earth) and Death Star models will contain peopleâ€™s names and photos, which will be transmitted to distance stars via lasers. The on-board EMIC2 Text to Speech module that will speak peoples names in Darth Vader's voice.
