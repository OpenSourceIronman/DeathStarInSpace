This Git repo is broken down into the following two folders / directories (***PYTHON_Code, SPIN_Code***). The Python_Code directory holds prototype code used to test the system on the ground using a Raspberry Pi 3 B+. The SPIN_Code directory holds the flight code that will be running on a Parallax Propeller 1 microcontroller while the Death Star rides a rocket into space!

***

SPIN_Code: 

https://www.parallax.com/product/32810

To run the code in SPIN_Code directory complete the following steps:
1. Download and open the Parallax Propeller Tool / IDE.
2. File > Open (Ctrl+O) the DeathStarDriver.SPIN file
3. Run > Compile Current > Load EEPROM (F11) to programm EEPROM and start Death Star software running. 

***

PYTHON_Code: 

https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus/

To run the code in PYTHON_Code directory complete the following steps:
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the PYTHON_Code using the "cd" command.
2. Run the command "python DeathStarDriver.py" to start Death Star software running.
3. Enter ternimal input as prompted to test individual subsystems. 

*** 

We will be launching a $??K crowd funding campaign Dec 20, 2018 to raise funding for the flight hardware.
